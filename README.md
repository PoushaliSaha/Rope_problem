# Rope_problem

1.	Given N ropes of length L1, L2, L3 ... LN. I need to join every rope to get a final rope of length L1 + L2 + L3 + ... + LN.
2.	However, I can only join two ropes at a time and the cost of joining two ropes is Li + Lj.
3.	I am supposed to join all ropes (into a one single rope) in such a way that the cost is minimum.
4.	Design an algorithm to find this and write a program for the same (in whichever language you prefer).
